# Employees' KPI Dashboard
This project aims to highlight a number of KPIs to provide insights into the organisational structure, management distribution across departments, and the compensation structure. 

It is important for organisations to monitor and improve gender diversity to create inclusivity and equal opportunities. On the other hand, compensation structure should be used to assess the competitiveness of the company's salary against industry benchmarks, ensuring top talent remains while contributing to a positive corporate culture.

The dataset called "employees_mod" comprises multiple tables ("t_departments, t_dept_emp, t_dept_manager, t_employees, t_salaries") , each containing distinct and varied information. For the scope of this project we will have to:

 #### Task 1:  Create a breakdown between male and female employees working each year since 1990.
 ####  Task 2: Compare the number of male managers to the number of female managers from different departments for each year  since 1990.
 ####  Task 3: Compare average salary between male and female across the whole organization until year 2022 whilst filerting by department.
 ####  Task 4: Create a SQL stored procedure to obtain the average male & female salary per department within a certain salary range. Let the range be defined by two values that user can insert when calling the procedure.

To acomplish the above tasks, please download the dataset called "employees_mod" from DropBox.

#### Note: Please download the above dataset and review the code facilitated if you struggle to obtain the same results for this project. The csv files are also to help you understand the data that needs to be pulled in SQL before importing it into Tableau to create our KPI visualisation.
